## Quiz Recommended Algorithms

Quiz recommendation is Random based by default. If you solve more than 100 questions, I recommend a question similar to the wrong one.

## User Answer Processing Algorithms

The answer entered by the user and the prompt managed by the DB are combined and delivered to Chat AI. Since the prompt changes very little, it uses caching to reduce the I/O load.
